# Chapter 1: Why migrate? - Uncovering the hidden cost of iceberg


“The greatest danger in times of turbulence is not the turbulence—it is to act with yesterday’s logic.” — Peter Drucker


## Clarifing *why* You're migrating


On the surface, your data pipelines might appear to be running smoothly. The dashboards update mostly on time, and stakeholders see the charts they expect each morning. 
But behind that polished facade, perhaps your team pulled a late-night scramble to fix a broken data feed, or you’re nursing along a fragile script that could fail with the next API update. 
It’s a bit like **the tip of an iceberg** – the business sees the visible successes above water, while beneath the surface lies a massive chunk of unseen effort and risk. 
In data engineering, this is the **hidden cost of ownership**: all the maintenance, troubleshooting, and technical debt that aren’t immediately obvious in day-to-day operations.

Why talk about icebergs in a data handbook? Because **what you don’t see can hurt you**. If you’re considering a migration to a better pipeline tool, it’s likely because you’ve felt these hidden pains. 
In this opening chapter, we’ll explore the often-unseen problems (“negative motivators”) that push teams to seek change, as well as the positive goals and opportunities that pull them toward a solution. 
We’ll use the iceberg as our guide – first examining the deep, cold challenges under the water, then rising up to the sunny opportunities above. 
By the end of this chapter, you should have a clear sense of why a migration to **dlt** might be worth the effort, and you’ll document your own motivations before we jump into building your first pipeline in Chapter 2.



## Uncovering the hidden cost of iceberg - SaaS ETL vs. Home-Grown Pipelines

Many teams either rely on a third-party **SaaS ETL** platform or maintain a **home-grown Python pipeline**. Both approaches have their own “icebergs” of hidden pain driving the urge to migrate to a better solution like **dlt**. Here’s a side-by-side look at the top three pain points in each scenario:

| **If You Use a SaaS ETL Tool** (e.g. Fivetran, Stitch)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | **If You Use Home-Grown Scripts** (DIY pipelines)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High Cost & Lock-In:** Managed ETL services often charge based on data volume or connectors, and those fees **balloon as you scale**. You’re essentially **renting your pipelines**, which creates **vendor lock-in** (it’s hard to leave once all your data flows through their system). Over time, those rising subscription costs and lack of ownership become a major pain.                                                                                                            | **Chornic Maintenance Overload:** Keeping custom pipelines running is a constant grind. On average, data engineers spend \~**44% of their time** just **fixing and maintaining pipelines** – roughly **\$520K/year in salary** for a 12-person team wasted on “pipeline babysitting.” Each schema change or API update can break something, leading to late-night fire-fighting and patches. This drudgery not only burns time and money, but also crushes morale (three-quarters of engineers feel their talent is misused on low-level upkeep).                   |
| **Limited Flexibility & Coverage:** A SaaS tool only supports what its vendor builds. Need a **new or niche data source**? If it’s not on their connector list, you face lengthy waits or hacky workarounds. Complex custom logic or special transformations can be hard to implement in a closed platform. In short, the **one-size-fits-all** nature of SaaS can hold you back when your needs don’t fit their mold.                                                                       | **Fragility & Frequent Breakages:** DIY pipelines can be **brittle**. A minor upstream schema change or a brief source outage – things a robust tool would handle gracefully – often **crashes the whole pipeline**. Because these scripts lack automated schema management or error recovery, **every hiccup turns into an incident**. It’s a vicious cycle of reactive fixes (as one report noted, teams endure “weekend debugging” sessions for broken pipelines), piling up technical debt with each quick fix.                                               |
| **Lack of Control & Transparency:** With a third-party ETL, you **surrender control** over your data flow. You can’t easily tweak the internals or troubleshoot issues on your own – you’re dependent on the vendor for improvements or support. This black-box approach can be uncomfortable for engineering-centric teams. Integration with your dev workflow is limited (e.g. harder to version-control or test pipelines in code), which means less agility compared to owning the code. | **Scaling & Agility Challenges:** What works for one or two pipelines becomes unwieldy as you grow. Each new data source or business request might require **weeks of custom coding** and setup in a home-grown system. There’s no easy plug-and-play expansion. As data volume increases, performance may lag or costs spike due to inefficient full reprocessing. In short, a DIY pipeline that was “good enough” early on can **struggle to keep up with 10x growth** – the lack of built-in scalability and optimization becomes a roadblock to the business. |

**In summary:** whether it’s the **skyrocketing costs and constraints of SaaS** or the **time-sink and fragility of DIY scripts**, these pain points are likely what have you looking for a better way. The goal of migrating to a modern solution like dlt is to **escape these headaches** – cutting hidden costs, easing maintenance, and regaining control – so your data team can spend more time delivering value and less time fighting fires.


## Rising above to embrace migration - Positive motivators

Perfect. I’ll revise the second half of Chapter 1 starting from the 'Positive Motivators' section, keeping the original narrative tone, while improving alignment with the 3+3 pain points. I’ll also refine the 'What is dlt' section to better fit this updated framing.

I’ll share the polished draft shortly.


## Positive Motivators

Having identified the pitfalls of both SaaS ETL tools and homegrown pipelines, it’s time to focus on the upside of moving to a better approach. Below are the key **motivators** driving this migration – each one directly addressing a pain point we’ve discussed:

1. **Lower Cost & No Vendor Lock-In:** By adopting an open solution, you escape escalating subscription fees and proprietary traps. Many fully managed ETL services charge **tens of thousands of dollars per year**, and those costs only climb as data volumes grow. A code-centric, open-source tool has **no license fees** and lets you own your pipelines end-to-end, ensuring you’re never beholden to a vendor’s pricing or roadmap.

2. **Full Orchestration & Control:** A new approach should give you **complete control over scheduling and orchestration** of your data flows. Rather than fitting into a SaaS tool’s limited workflow, you can integrate with robust orchestrators or your existing DevOps processes. In practice, this means you decide when and how pipelines run, chain tasks as needed, and cover every data source or transformation your business requires – not just the ones a vendor supports. The result is **greater coverage** of use cases and the flexibility to adapt flows on your terms.

3. **Transparent, Resilient Pipelines:** Ditching fragile GUI-based setups for code-driven pipelines brings much-needed transparency. With a code-first pipeline, you can version-control your logic, inspect what’s happening under the hood, and add thorough monitoring. This visibility makes pipelines **more robust and easier to debug** – no more blind spots when something breaks. A well-designed code pipeline can also incorporate error handling and retries, meaning **fewer silent failures** and the confidence that data will arrive intact.

4. **Reduced Maintenance Through Automation:** Maintaining DIY scripts can feel like a never-ending manual slog. A modern pipeline framework **automates repetitive work** – from managing API calls to handling schema changes – so your team spends less time writing glue code and patching things. Out-of-the-box connectors and transformations replace many custom scripts, slashing the maintenance workload. In short, you free up engineering time and energy, shifting focus from babysitting pipelines to higher-value tasks.

5. **Built-in Resilience to Change & Outages:** Data sources are never static – schemas evolve, and outages happen. A strong motivator for change is to gain **resilience by design**. The right tool will **adapt to schema drift** (e.g. auto-detect new fields and adjust) and gracefully recover from errors. For instance, with dlt the schema can automatically evolve when new columns or tables appear, and if a loading job fails, it’s safe to rerun without losing progress. This means far fewer broken pipelines when an API updates or a network blip occurs – a huge reliability boost over brittle scripts.

6. **Scalable & Adaptable Architecture:** Finally, the new solution must scale with your data and adapt as your needs grow. An open architecture built on code can **scale out processing** (you can run it on more powerful infrastructure or in parallel) and handle increasing volumes without a complete rewrite. You can add new sources or destinations as needed, since you’re not limited to a vendor’s feature set. In other words, the pipeline framework grows with you – accommodating everything from a quick one-off dataset to a full enterprise data platform with equal ease. This future-proofing ensures today’s investment keeps paying off as data demands expand.

Each motivator above corresponds to a pain point we’re turning into an opportunity. By pursuing these benefits, we set the stage for a solution that combines the agility of DIY coding with the reliability of enterprise tools – without the downsides of either.

## What is dlt?

**dlt** (which stands for **data load tool**) is the embodiment of these ideals – an open-source library designed to make data pipelines *simple, powerful,* and **team-friendly**. In essence, dlt turns raw data from various sources into live tables in your destination of choice with minimal fuss. Unlike heavyweight ETL platforms, it doesn’t require complex server setups or proprietary UI; instead, it lives in your Python codebase, letting you build and run pipelines just as you would write a script.

**How does dlt address our motivators?** First, cost and lock-in cease to be an issue. dlt is free to use (no per-seat or per-row charges), and being open-source means you have full ownership. You’re investing in your own stack rather than someone else’s platform. While open-source tools aren’t “free” in effort, dlt is designed to minimize the overhead – it’s *pip-installable* and works out-of-the-box, so you can get productive without lengthy setup or specialized skills.

Second, dlt gives you **ultimate control and flexibility**. Because it’s just Python, you can run it **anywhere Python runs** – locally for development, on your cloud of choice, or embedded in orchestrators like Airflow or Dagster. You decide how to schedule and deploy pipelines. Need to integrate with existing systems or include custom logic? You have the entire Python ecosystem at your disposal. dlt acts as a bridge between the modern data stack and custom code, so it fits neatly into your current processes instead of forcing you to adapt to a new SaaS workflow.

Crucially, dlt brings **robustness and automation** to reduce maintenance. It comes with a rich set of pre-built connectors (covering sources from Slack to Stripe and destinations from BigQuery to Snowflake), which immediately covers many use cases without extra code. Its pipeline engine handles the heavy lifting: extracting data, normalizing formats, and loading to the destination with proper schema management. In fact, dlt pipelines automatically normalize nested data and even perform incremental loading for efficiency. Schema changes are handled gracefully – if your source adds a new field, dlt will detect it and evolve the target schema accordingly. If a run is interrupted, you can restart it without duplicating or corrupting data. All of this translates to **far less manual intervention** day-to-day. Your team spends less time fixing broken SQL or tweaking cron jobs, and more time delivering value from the data.

Finally, dlt is built to **scale and adapt** with your needs. Since you manage the environment, you can scale vertically (run on a beefier machine) or horizontally (distribute workloads) as data grows, without hitting a vendor’s limits. And because it’s modular and code-driven, adding a new source or a custom transformation is straightforward – you’re never stuck waiting for a feature request to be implemented by someone else. This adaptability means dlt stays useful in the long run, whether you’re handling a handful of data sources today or dozens tomorrow.

In summary, *dlt provides a pragmatic path forward* for data engineering teams. It addresses the six critical pain points by offering a solution that is cost-effective, controlled by you, transparent in operation, low-maintenance, resilient to change, and ready to scale. Importantly, it does so in a grounded way: you leverage standard Python skills and practices (so there’s no steep learning curve or black-box magic). For organizations seeking to modernize their pipelines without losing control, dlt presents a compelling option – marrying the reliability of a proven framework with the freedom of a DIY approach. It’s the toolkit that turns those positive motivators into real outcomes, empowering your team to build a future-proof data foundation with confidence.


## Self-Evaluation: Pipeline Migration Readiness Scorecard

At this point, you’ve heard the cautionary tales and the enticing benefits. But how do you know if **you** should migrate now? Every organization is at a different stage. To help you evaluate your pipeline’s readiness (and your team’s appetite) for a migration to dlt, use this simple scorecard. It’s a set of Yes/No (or 1–5 scale) questions to honestly ask yourself and your team:

1. **Maintenance Burden:** Is your team spending a significant portion of time (say over 30%) on routine pipeline maintenance and firefighting? – *(If your gut says “yes” and research shows \~44% time is common, that’s a strong sign of pain.)*

2. **Frequency of Breakages:** How often do your pipelines fail or data quality issues arise? – *(Daily/weekly failures indicate high fragility. Even “monthly” might mask larger issues. Ideally, failures should be rare and quickly resolved.)*

3. **Responsiveness to Change:** When a new data source or a schema change in an existing source comes up, can you incorporate it in days? Or do such changes cause multi-week projects and significant rework? – *(Slow adaptation means your pipeline tech is holding back the business.)*

4. **Team Morale and Bandwidth:** Do your data engineers complain about “pipeline babysitting” or do you sense frustration with current tools? Are you postponing valuable projects because the team is tied up fixing bugs? – *(A yes here suggests a migration could free up and re-energize your talent.)*

5. **Cost and Resources:** Are you running up against budget issues with your current pipeline approach? (For example, high cloud compute costs due to inefficient jobs, or expensive license fees for proprietary ETL software.) – *(Optimized loading and open-source tools like dlt could cut costs. Conversely, not migrating might force you into hiring more people just to maintain status quo.)*

6. **Security and Compliance:** Do your current pipelines raise any security or compliance concerns (e.g., hard-coded credentials, lack of audit logs, data not handled according to policy)? – *(Modern tools often have built-in credential management and better logging. A migration might improve your security posture.)*

7. **Scalability for the Future:** Looking ahead 1-2 years, can your current pipeline architecture handle 2x or 10x the data volume and more complexity? – *(If not, it’s better to address it before it becomes an emergency. A yes here would mean you’re confident in your current setup’s longevity; a no means you likely need to migrate at some point anyway.)*

8. **Stakeholder Trust:** Do business users trust your data pipeline output, or are there frequent complaints about data latency or accuracy? – *(If trust is eroding, a new solution that promises reliability could restore confidence in the data program.)*

Go through these questions and score yourself. If you find you answered “Yes” to many of the pain indicators (or rated several factors poorly), it’s a strong indication that you’re a good candidate for migration. On the other hand, if you answered “No, we’re fine” to most – perhaps your pipelines are already in great shape! But chances are, if you’re reading this, you have at least a few areas of concern.

There’s no exact cutoff, but as a rule of thumb: **if more than 2–3 of these points are major issues for you, it’s time to seriously consider a migration**. Even one critical “yes” (like a very high maintenance burden or an inability to scale for a known upcoming need) can be reason enough. This scorecard is about being honest with where your pipeline stands.

## Document *Your* Motivation (Exercise)

Before we move on, let’s turn reflection into action. One hallmark of a successful migration project is having a clear vision of *why* you’re doing it. It’s easy to get lost in the weeds of technical steps, but your motivation is the north star guiding the effort.

**Take a moment now to document your motivation for migrating to dlt.** This can be a simple bullet list or a short narrative. We recommend actually creating a Markdown file (perhaps call it `Migration_Motivation.md` in your project folder) where you write this down. Why Markdown? Because you’re likely working in a GitHub or code-oriented environment (and it’s fitting for a GitHub-based ebook). Plus, writing it in Markdown means you can easily share it with your team or even include it in documentation later.

Not sure what to write? Here are some prompts:

* List the top 3 pain points with your current pipeline.
* List the top 3 positive outcomes you hope to achieve for example faster loading, less cost, more innovation, etc.
* State any specific goals or KPIs, if you have them (e.g., “reduce pipeline failures to near-zero” or “enable integration of 5 new data sources in the next quarter”).
* If applicable, note any deadlines or strategic drivers (e.g., “we need to scale before holiday season” or “our data team headcount is limited, so efficiency is crucial”).

For example, your motivation might read: *“We are migrating to dlt to cut down maintenance time (currently \~40% of our sprint cycles). We want to eliminate nightly pipeline failures and deliver fresher data to marketing (goal: data no more than 1 hour behind real-time). Additionally, we aim to save on our cloud ETL costs by doing incremental loading. Ultimately, the migration should free up our engineers to focus on analytics and machine learning projects rather than pipeline fixes.”*

Having this written down creates accountability and clarity. It will help you communicate to stakeholders (your team, your boss, maybe other departments) **why** this migration is worth the effort. In project kickoff meetings, you can refer back to this “why” document to keep everyone aligned. In fact, a cloud provider’s migration checklist advises teams to *“outline your goals”* at the start – whether it’s reducing costs, increasing reliability, improving performance, or preparing for scale. These guiding reasons will influence many decisions in your 7-step journey.

*(If you’re feeling extra organized, you can even commit this Markdown file to your repository – it’s a living reminder of the vision. And when the migration is done, it’s rewarding to look back and see how the outcomes compare to the initial goals.)*

## Next Stop: Quick Wins with Your First dlt Pipeline

Congratulations – you’ve completed the crucial first step of the 7-Step Migration Blueprint! In this chapter, we surfaced the hidden problems and clarified the motivations for change. You should now understand the “iceberg” of data pipeline ownership and have your own reasons to proceed. By writing down your motivation, you’ve set the foundation for a purposeful migration.

Now it’s time to get our hands dirty and build momentum. In **Chapter 2**, we’ll shift from why to how: **we’ll guide you through building your first pipeline with dlt, quickly**. This will be a fast, tangible win – a simple pipeline that you can get running in minutes, to demonstrate how dlt works and prove out the benefits on a small scale. It’s all about showing that *“yes, this new approach can deliver value immediately.”*

By the end of Chapter 2, you’ll have a basic dlt pipeline pulling data from a source and loading it into a destination of your choice. This experience will not only boost your confidence in the tool, but also give your team something concrete to rally around as you continue the migration. Ready to dive in? **Let’s build something awesome with dlt in the next chapter!** 🚀
