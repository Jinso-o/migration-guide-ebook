# Chapter 1: Why migrate? - Uncovering the hidden cost of iceberg

## Clarifing *why* You're migrating


On the surface, your data pipelines might appear to be running smoothly. The dashboards update mostly on time, and stakeholders see the charts they expect each morning. 
But behind that polished facade, perhaps your team pulled a late-night scramble to fix a broken data feed, or you’re nursing along a fragile script that could fail with the next API update. 
It’s a bit like **the tip of an iceberg** – the business sees the visible successes above water, while beneath the surface lies a massive chunk of unseen effort and risk. 
In data engineering, this is the **hidden cost of ownership**: all the maintenance, troubleshooting, and technical debt that aren’t immediately obvious in day-to-day operations.

Why talk about icebergs in a data handbook? Because **what you don’t see can hurt you**. If you’re considering a migration to a better pipeline tool, it’s likely because you’ve felt these hidden pains. 
In this opening chapter, we’ll explore the often-unseen problems (“negative motivators”) that push teams to seek change, as well as the positive goals and opportunities that pull them toward a solution. 
We’ll use the iceberg as our guide – first examining the deep, cold challenges under the water, then rising up to the sunny opportunities above. 
By the end of this chapter, you should have a clear sense of why a migration to **dlt** might be worth the effort, and you’ll document your own motivations before we jump into building your first pipeline in Chapter 2.



## Uncovering the hidden cost of iceberg - SaaS ETL vs. Home-Grown Pipelines

Many teams either rely on a third-party **SaaS ETL** platform or maintain a **home-grown Python pipeline**. Both approaches have their own “icebergs” of hidden pain driving the urge to migrate to a better solution like **dlt**. Here’s a side-by-side look at the top three pain points in each scenario:

| **If You Use a SaaS ETL Tool** (e.g. Fivetran, Stitch)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | **If You Use Home-Grown Scripts** (DIY pipelines)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High Cost & Lock-In:** Managed ETL services often charge based on data volume or connectors, and those fees **balloon as you scale**. You’re essentially **renting your pipelines**, which creates **vendor lock-in** (it’s hard to leave once all your data flows through their system). Over time, those rising subscription costs and lack of ownership become a major pain.                                                                                                            | **Chornic Maintenance Overload:** Keeping custom pipelines running is a constant grind. On average, data engineers spend \~**44% of their time** just **fixing and maintaining pipelines** – roughly **\$520K/year in salary** for a 12-person team wasted on “pipeline babysitting.” Each schema change or API update can break something, leading to late-night fire-fighting and patches. This drudgery not only burns time and money, but also crushes morale (three-quarters of engineers feel their talent is misused on low-level upkeep).                   |
| **Limited Flexibility & Coverage:** A SaaS tool only supports what its vendor builds. Need a **new or niche data source**? If it’s not on their connector list, you face lengthy waits or hacky workarounds. Complex custom logic or special transformations can be hard to implement in a closed platform. In short, the **one-size-fits-all** nature of SaaS can hold you back when your needs don’t fit their mold.                                                                       | **Fragility & Frequent Breakages:** DIY pipelines can be **brittle**. A minor upstream schema change or a brief source outage – things a robust tool would handle gracefully – often **crashes the whole pipeline**. Because these scripts lack automated schema management or error recovery, **every hiccup turns into an incident**. It’s a vicious cycle of reactive fixes (as one report noted, teams endure “weekend debugging” sessions for broken pipelines), piling up technical debt with each quick fix.                                               |
| **Lack of Control & Transparency:** With a third-party ETL, you **surrender control** over your data flow. You can’t easily tweak the internals or troubleshoot issues on your own – you’re dependent on the vendor for improvements or support. This black-box approach can be uncomfortable for engineering-centric teams. Integration with your dev workflow is limited (e.g. harder to version-control or test pipelines in code), which means less agility compared to owning the code. | **Scaling & Agility Challenges:** What works for one or two pipelines becomes unwieldy as you grow. Each new data source or business request might require **weeks of custom coding** and setup in a home-grown system. There’s no easy plug-and-play expansion. As data volume increases, performance may lag or costs spike due to inefficient full reprocessing. In short, a DIY pipeline that was “good enough” early on can **struggle to keep up with 10x growth** – the lack of built-in scalability and optimization becomes a roadblock to the business. |

**In summary:** whether it’s the **skyrocketing costs and constraints of SaaS** or the **time-sink and fragility of DIY scripts**, these pain points are likely what have you looking for a better way. The goal of migrating to a modern solution like dlt is to **escape these headaches** – cutting hidden costs, easing maintenance, and regaining control – so your data team can spend more time delivering value and less time fighting fires.


## Rising above to embrace migration - Positive motivators

Having identified the pitfalls of both SaaS ETL tools and homegrown pipelines, it’s time to focus on the upside of moving to a better approach. Below are the key **motivators** driving this migration – each one directly addressing a pain point we’ve discussed:

1. **Lower Cost & No Vendor Lock-In:** By adopting an open solution, you escape escalating subscription fees and proprietary traps. Many fully managed ETL services charge **tens of thousands of dollars per year**, and those costs only climb as data volumes grow. A code-centric, open-source tool has **no license fees** and lets you own your pipelines end-to-end, ensuring you’re never beholden to a vendor’s pricing or roadmap.

2. **Full Orchestration & Control:** A new approach should give you **complete control over scheduling and orchestration** of your data flows. Rather than fitting into a SaaS tool’s limited workflow, you can integrate with robust orchestrators or your existing DevOps processes. In practice, this means you decide when and how pipelines run, chain tasks as needed, and cover every data source or transformation your business requires – not just the ones a vendor supports. The result is **greater coverage** of use cases and the flexibility to adapt flows on your terms.

3. **Transparent, Resilient Pipelines:** Ditching fragile GUI-based setups for code-driven pipelines brings much-needed transparency. With a code-first pipeline, you can version-control your logic, inspect what’s happening under the hood, and add thorough monitoring. This visibility makes pipelines **more robust and easier to debug** – no more blind spots when something breaks. A well-designed code pipeline can also incorporate error handling and retries, meaning **fewer silent failures** and the confidence that data will arrive intact.

4. **Reduced Maintenance Through Automation:** Maintaining DIY scripts can feel like a never-ending manual slog. A modern pipeline framework **automates repetitive work** – from managing API calls to handling schema changes – so your team spends less time writing glue code and patching things. Out-of-the-box connectors and transformations replace many custom scripts, slashing the maintenance workload. In short, you free up engineering time and energy, shifting focus from babysitting pipelines to higher-value tasks.

5. **Built-in Resilience to Change & Outages:** Data sources are never static – schemas evolve, and outages happen. A strong motivator for change is to gain **resilience by design**. The right tool will **adapt to schema drift** (e.g. auto-detect new fields and adjust) and gracefully recover from errors. For instance, with dlt the schema can automatically evolve when new columns or tables appear, and if a loading job fails, it’s safe to rerun without losing progress. This means far fewer broken pipelines when an API updates or a network blip occurs – a huge reliability boost over brittle scripts.

6. **Scalable & Adaptable Architecture:** Finally, the new solution must scale with your data and adapt as your needs grow. An open architecture built on code can **scale out processing** (you can run it on more powerful infrastructure or in parallel) and handle increasing volumes without a complete rewrite. You can add new sources or destinations as needed, since you’re not limited to a vendor’s feature set. In other words, the pipeline framework grows with you – accommodating everything from a quick one-off dataset to a full enterprise data platform with equal ease. This future-proofing ensures today’s investment keeps paying off as data demands expand.

Each motivator above corresponds to a pain point we’re turning into an opportunity. By pursuing these benefits, we set the stage for a solution that combines the agility of DIY coding with the reliability of enterprise tools – without the downsides of either.

## Self-Evaluation: Pipeline Migration Readiness Scorecard

At this point, you’ve heard the cautionary tales and the enticing benefits. But how do you know if **you** should migrate now? Every organization is at a different stage. To help you evaluate your pipeline’s readiness for a migration to dlt, use this simple scorecard. It’s a set of Yes/No/Unnessasry questions to honestly ask yourself and your team:

1. **Maintenance Burden:** Is your team spending a lot of time on routine pipeline maintenance?

2. **Frequency of Breakages:** Is your team spending a lot of time on routine pipeline maintenance?

3. **Responsiveness to Change:** Can you quickly incorporate new data sources or schema changes?

4. **Team Morale and Bandwidth:** Is your team frustrated with current tools or tied up fixing bugs?
   
6. **Cost and Resources:** Are you facing budget issues with your current pipeline approach?

7. **Security and Compliance:** Do your current pipelines raise any security or compliance concerns (e.g., hard-coded credentials, lack of audit logs, data not handled according to policy)? 

8. **Scalability for the Future:** Can your current pipeline handle significantly more data volume in the future?

9. **Stakeholder Trust:** Do business users trust your data pipeline output?

Go through these questions and score yourself. If you find you answered “Yes” to many of the pain indicators or rated several factors poorly, it’s a strong indication that you’re a good candidate for migration. 

There will be no exact cutoff, but as a rule of thumb: **if more than 2–3 of these points are major issues for you, it’s time to seriously consider a migration**. Even one critical “yes” (like a very high maintenance burden or an inability to scale for a known upcoming need) can be reason enough. This scorecard is about being honest with where your pipeline stands. SO you know to head now to solve your challenges!

## Document *Your* Motivation (Exercise)

Before we move on, let’s turn reflection into action. One hallmark of a successful migration project is having a clear vision of *why* you’re doing it. It’s easy to get lost in the weeds of technical steps, but your motivation is the north star guiding the effort.

**Take a moment now to document your motivation for migrating to dlt.** This can be a simple bullet list or a short narrative. We recommend actually creating a Markdown file (perhaps call it `Migration_Motivation.md` in your project folder) where you write this down. 

Not sure what to write? Here are some drafts:

* List the top 3 pain points with your current pipeline.
* List the top 3 positive outcomes you hope to achieve for example faster loading, less cost, more innovation, etc.
* State any specific goals or KPIs, if you have them (e.g., “reduce pipeline failures to near-zero” or “enable integration of 5 new data sources in the next quarter”).
* If applicable, note any deadlines or strategic drivers (e.g., “we need to scale before holiday season” or “our data team headcount is limited, so efficiency is crucial”).

For example, your motivation might like: *“We are migrating to dlt to cut down maintenance time, We want to eliminate nightly pipeline failures and deliver fresher data to marketing and goal is to have the data no more than 1 hour behind real-time. Also it could be, we aim to save on our cloud ETL costs by doing incremental loading or the migration should free up our engineers to focus on analytics and machine learning projects rather than pipeline fixes.”*

Having this written down creates accountability and clarity. It will help you communicate to stakeholders **why** this migration is worth the effort. In project kickoff meetings, you can reference back to this “why” document to keep everyone aligned. In fact, a cloud provider’s migration checklist advises teams to *“outline your goals”* at the start – whether it’s reducing costs, increasing reliability, improving performance, or preparing for scale. These guiding reasons will influence many decisions in your 7-step journey.
